Hey Java developers,

Have a test with multiple assertions

And getting frustrated you have to execute it multiple times 

to resolve all the assertion failures?

Use assertAll, part of JUnit 5, 

which can wrap multiple assertions 

and return all the failures 

in a single test execution

Happy Testing!
