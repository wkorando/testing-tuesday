Hey Java Developers,

2
00:00:02,433 --> 00:00:04,366
Have a test with multiple assertions

3
00:00:04,366 --> 00:00:07,500
And getting frustrated you have to execute it multiple times 

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,600
to resolve all the assertion failures?

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,066
Use assertAll, part of JUnit 5, 

6
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:14,033
which can wrap multiple assertions

7
00:00:14,033 --> 00:00:15,633
and return all the failures 

8
00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:17,400
in a single test execution

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:17,433
Happy testing!

10
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:18,566
Happy testing!
