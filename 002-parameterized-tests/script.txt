Hey Java developers,

Writing tests for a block of code that has a lot of branches?

Like in this example of validating fields within a form.

And find yourself copying and pasting the same test format to cover all the branches?

In these scenario, consider writing a parameterized test. 

A Parameterized Test, defined with the ParameterizedTest annotation in JUnit 5

Is a type of test where a scenario is defined

And then a data source is defined 

That passes different arguments into the scenario

Improving the maintainability and expandability

Parameterized tests can take several different data sources types

Happy Testing!
